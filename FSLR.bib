  doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.074},
  abstract = {Background
Brain atrophy studies often use {FSL}-{BET} (Brain Extraction Tool) as the first step of image processing. Default {BET} does not always give satisfactory results on 3DT1 {MR} images, which negatively impacts atrophy measurements. Finding the right alternative {BET} settings can be a difficult and time-consuming task, which can introduce unwanted variability.
Aim
To systematically analyze the performance of {BET} in images of {MS} patients by varying its parameters and options combinations, and quantitatively comparing its results to a manual gold standard.
Methods
Images from 159 {MS} patients were selected from different {MAGNIMS} consortium centers, and 16 different 3DT1 acquisition protocols at 1.5 T or 3 T. Before running {BET}, one of three pre-processing pipelines was applied: (1) no pre-processing, (2) removal of neck slices, or (3) additional N3 inhomogeneity correction. Then {BET} was applied, systematically varying the fractional intensity threshold (the “f” parameter) and with either one of the main {BET} options (“B” — bias field correction and neck cleanup, “R” — robust brain center estimation, or “S” — eye and optic nerve cleanup) or none. For comparison, intracranial cavity masks were manually created for all image volumes. {FSL}-{FAST} ({FMRIB}'s Automated Segmentation Tool) tissue-type segmentation was run on all {BET} output images and on the image volumes masked with the manual intracranial cavity masks (thus creating the gold-standard tissue masks). The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to the gold standard using Dice overlap coefficient ({DOC}). Normalized brain volumes ({NBV}) were calculated with {SIENAX}. {NBV} values obtained using for {SIENAX} other {BET} settings than default were compared to gold standard {NBV} with the paired t-test.
Results
The parameter/preprocessing/options combinations resulted in 20,988 {BET} runs. The median {DOC} for default {BET} (f = 0.5, g = 0) was 0.913 (range 0.321–0.977) across all 159 native scans. For all acquisition protocols, brain extraction was substantially improved for lower values of “f” than the default value. Using native images, optimum {BET} performance was observed for f = 0.2 with option “B”, giving median {DOC} = 0.979 (range 0.867–0.994). Using neck removal before {BET}, optimum {BET} performance was observed for f = 0.1 with option “B”, giving median {DOC} 0.983 (range 0.844–0.996). Using the above {BET}-options for {SIENAX} instead of default, the {NBV} values obtained from images after neck removal with f = 0.1 and option “B” did not differ statistically from {NBV} values obtained with gold-standard.
Conclusion
Although default {BET} performs reasonably well on most 3DT1 images of {MS} patients, the performance can be improved substantially. The removal of the neck slices, either externally or within {BET}, has a marked positive effect on the brain extraction quality. {BET} option “B” with f = 0.1 after removal of the neck slices seems to work best for all acquisition protocols.},

  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools ({ANTs}), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA}'s {LPBA}40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},
